# General description

`gate` is a port of the infamous `pwdmgr` of mine (written in Eiffel),
but this time written in Go.

The aim is to provide a very simple interface to a passwords database.

The technical aim is to remove a lot of the lower layers of
unmaintained software `pwdmgr` was written with; and instead, bet on
promising technologies.
